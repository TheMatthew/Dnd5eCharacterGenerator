# D&D 5e Character Generator

This is a lightweight, browser-based Dungeons & Dragons 5e character generator that integrates with the [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/). Answer a few personality-driven slider questions and the generator will recommend a class, pulling real-time class data (hit dice, proficiencies, etc.) from the API.

## 🚀 Features

- Slider-based Likert questions for personality input
- Recommends a character class based on alignment traits
- Fetches live data from the D&D 5e API
- Simple, responsive, no server required

## 🔧 Usage

1. Run `npm start`
2. Make sure Ollama and Stable Diffusion are running already.
3. Open localhost:3000
4. Adjust the sliders based on your character's personality.
5. Click "Generate Character" to get a recommended class and its details.

> ⚠️ Requires an internet connection to fetch data from the [dnd5eapi.co](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) site.
